=============

In this project we attempt to build a Telugu language keyboard for android devices.

Key Points:
Keyboard uses English keys.
User can type in English, the internal logic converts into nearest Telugu word and displays it in Telugu font.


As part of the first phase - We would just introduce the transliteration logic.
